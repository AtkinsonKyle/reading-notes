# SQL

### SQL Bolt

- Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database

- To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often refered to as queries

- SQL doesn't require you to write the keywords all capitalized, but it helps people distinguish SQL keywords from column and tables names, and makes the query easier to read

- The WHERE clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not

```

    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;

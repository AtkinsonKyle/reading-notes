## What Google Learned About Teams

<hr>

### Things To Know

- ‘‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work. It turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.’’ -Abeer Dubey. I don't agree with this because at some point two or more friends will butt heads and the team can essentially lose its close adhesion. One of the rules of business is to never work with friends or family due to this reason. What do you think?
- Project Aristotle was organized to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared
- "Group norms" are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather
- Google’s data, from Project Aristotle, indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work

### My Opinion

- As long as everyone gets a chance to talk, the collective intelligence is relatively similar, and there are great "group norms"(no one stepping on each other's toes or trying to be a jerk.) a team can be succesful. Everyone needs to receive the same workload and no one slacks off, a team can be good to go. Adhesion doesn't matter, you don't have to be friends outside of work, but as long as everyone treats each other with respect a team can flow well.

## Superagent

- SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs.
- A request can be initiated by invoking the appropriate method on the request object, then calling .then() (or .end() or await) to send the request.

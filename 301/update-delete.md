- The `action` attribute defines where the data gets sent

- The `method` attribute defines how data is sent

- The `GET` method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource."

- The `POST` method talks to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request

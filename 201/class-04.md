#### Things to Know
- Links are created using the `<a>` tag
- The `<a>` element uses the href attribute, like src to indicate the page you are linking to
- Two different links:
  - Relative Links are local
  - Absolute Links are on another server
- The id attribute targets tags within a page that can be linked to
- `mailto` is used for linking email programs to a webpage

#### Example
`<a href="http://donotclickme.com">Example Link</a>`

## Pair Programming
- Two Roles
  - The Driver: programmer typing
  - The Navigator: guides the driver using only their words
- Pair programming touches on four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
- Pair Programming helps build greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from others, communication, job interview readiness, work environment readiness
